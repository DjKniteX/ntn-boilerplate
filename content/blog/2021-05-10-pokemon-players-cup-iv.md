description: My Journey Through The Qualifers

Hey guys, this is my journey through the Players Cup IV Qualifiers. I gotta play through 50 qualifiers to get enough points to be TOP 256 in NA and I'm not even close. I'm about half way through my games and I barely just hit top 800.

Players Cup IV is the next tournament cup for all Pokemon related games: Sword/Shields, Pokken, and TCG. Unfortunately due to the pandemic the 2020 Championship series has been cancelled so they moved on to the online platform for now.

In the TCG Cup, we are given 50 keys where would use them to play in the Qualifiers to earn enough points to be considered into the top 256 where we play for in brackets for the trophy.

Points are earned as follow:
- 1st place: 5 points

- 2nd place: 3 points

- 3rd & 4th place: 1 point each

- 5thâ€“8th place: 0 points

I been running a modified Eternatus-VMAX deck and I been having a lot of success going first (I always decide to go 2nd to be able to use supporters) but with Crobat Vs and getting a good starting hand I can start KOing pokemon on my 2nd or 3rd turn at full!

I don't have the stats how my win/loss ratio vs certain decks but I seem to be doing good against Mad Party and Zacian if I'm set up correctly. Single Strike Urshifu is pretty scary but good thing I run weakness guard energy (thank god for current rotation) which makes the matchup pretty easy as long as I'm set up with Boss Orders. I had an interesting battle against a sprittomb deck where I was able to stop him from hurting himself and been BOing his GXs/Vs for the win. First time I seen it in the qualifiers and it striked me as curious rather than been scared. It was fun though! Pikarom is a one where I think I'm about 50/50 but I think I do pretty well against it if I'm able to knock out their tag team before getting set up (Crushing Hammers OP).



I have only been able to win twice and not enough to take me to the top of the leaderboard but I have about 20 keys left and a couple weeks left to try and grind my tournament points. Sorry about no play by play but maybe during the last key I use for the qualifiers I would go down a play by play and see if I win that one!
