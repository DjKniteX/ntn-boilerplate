We are still in the midst of building our blog site dedicated to card games which may or may not be also a blog for all things general but for now we are keeping the site as is.

We are working on establishing an online TCG league consisting of digital card games that can also be played offline/physical (i.e Pokemon)

So welcome to our card game site which may or may not be our esports site or even general blog site.

But here's a placeholder kitten
